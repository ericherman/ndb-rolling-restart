TODO
 * getopts - (done) currently argv[1] will be used for the connection_string
   would be good to be able to set various options and such.
   * option: skip nodes up to id x
   * (done) option: connection->wait_until_ready wait_seconds
   * option: sleep wait_seconds
   * (done) option: verbosity
   * option: Ndb_cluster_connection->connect no_retries
   * option: Ndb_cluster_connection->connect retry_delay_in_seconds
   * option: Ndb_cluster_connection->connect verbosity
   * option: ndb_mgm_connect no_retries
   * option: ndb_mgm_connect retry_delay_secs
   * option: ndb_mgm_connect verbosity (same as connection->connect?)
 * restart one node per node group at a time
   * could provide a massive speed-up of the rolling restart
