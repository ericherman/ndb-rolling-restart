TODO
 * unit tests?
 * provide path to MySQL NDB Cluster installdir and then functional test?
 * getopts
   * option: help
   * if no -c, use use argv[1] for the connection_string
   * option: skip nodes up to id x
   * option: sleep wait_seconds
   * option: verbosity - should this be a global?
   * option: Ndb_cluster_connection->connect no_retries
   * option: Ndb_cluster_connection->connect retry_delay_in_seconds
   * option: Ndb_cluster_connection->connect verbosity
   * option: ndb_mgm_connect no_retries
   * option: ndb_mgm_connect retry_delay_secs
   * option: ndb_mgm_connect verbosity (same as connection->connect?)

 * restart one node per node group at a time
   * could provide a massive speed-up of the rolling restart
	* stop node 4
	* stop node 2
	* wait for stop to complete
	* start node 4
	* start node 2
   * testNodeRestart.cpp has an example which stops (crashes) one node per node
     group, see the functions crash_one_node_per_node_group, this is then
     followed e.g by:
	if (restarter.startNodes(dead_nodes, num_dead_nodes) != 0)
		return NDBT_FAILED;
	if (restarter.waitClusterStarted())
		return NDBT_FAILED;
      the restarter object is a class our test program access the NDB MGM API
      through this code is used in runMultiCrashTest function
        testNodeRestart -n MultiCrashTest T1
        storage/ndb/test/ndbapi/testNodeRestart.cpp
   * the NDB MGM API should support all those variants
   * need to check that we run with StopOnError set to 0, the entire program
     relies on that you can start, stop and restart using the NDB MGM API,
     this can only happen if the data node angel process is running,
     the NDB MGM API cannot start a data node after an OS restart e.g.
   * to stop a node without start, you have the nostart flag in
     ndb_mgm_restart4 that can be set
   * the wait for stop to complete is required since the stop command runs a
     graceful shutdown, this can take a few seconds since we try to avoid
     aborting transactions during stop

 * Add option to restart using initial, there are cases when this is required
     (although rare), a specific example is upgrade from 7.5 to 7.6
