This is in early experimental stage, not ready for use.

Very loosely based on storage/ndb/test/src/NdbRestarter.cpp

If you have cmake, you can try:
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. \
	-DNDBINCLUDE=${HOME}/builds/mysql-cluster-7.6/include \
	-DNDBLIB=${HOME}/builds/mysql-cluster-7.6/lib

A hand-rolled Makefile is provided as well, mostly only useful for development.
